Project Name: Metopia Credential Badge

Project Intro:

Metopia is a Web3's Growth-Oriented Contribution Platform. 

Metopia's badge protocol is designed to enable communities to record and recognize different on-chain contributions. Communities can leverage Metopia's diverse features to establish their own loyalty programs. The non-transferable badge protocol enables transparent recognition of contributions, customizable governance strategies, and a fair incentive system. This empowers communities to create transparent and equitable reward systems using non-transferable badges as the foundation. By implementing this approach, Metopia ensures that communities benefit from a transparent and fair community structure.

Metopia's Growth-Oriented Contribution Quests provide an exciting opportunity for Web3 users to discover various blockchains and engage with ecosystem projects. By completing these quests, users can earn Metopia XP and build their on-chain reputation as a universal identity in the Web3 world. This incentivizes users to engage more deeply with blockchain ecosystems, helps them discover new possibilities, and rewards them for their on-chain contributions.
